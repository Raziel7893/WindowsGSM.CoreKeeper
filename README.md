- Your World Save is stored in ServerFiles\Saves 
- To configure your server go to %USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Pugstorm\Core Keeper\DedicatedServer and edit ServerConfig.json
- If you want to import a world copy it
  - from your client %USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Pugstorm\Core Keeper\Steam\$YourSteamID\worlds\0.world.gzip
  - to your server serverfiles\Saves\worlds\0.world.gzip (or default if you don't override default location %USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Pugstorm\Core Keeper\DedicatedServer\worlds\0.world.gzip)
- If you don't want to use steam relay service, add parameter "-port 27015" (27015-27050) to host on your own ip. That needs Portforwarding of Port XXXXX TCP/UDP and a semi-static IPv4)
